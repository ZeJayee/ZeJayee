# Hello my fellow programmers!
(And just program enjoyers too.)
<br>
<i>Welcome to my page.</i>
<br>
<b>Who am I?</b>
<br>
I am an independently taught fifteen year old programmer from the eastern USA. I started real programming (upgraded from Scratch which I had used since third grade, age eight) over COVID at the age of eleven.
I use HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and I'm entirely front-end.
I'm still new and constantly learning, so I'd love to hear your ideas.
Thanks for stopping by!
